# Big Data-Driven Malware Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a malware detection system that uses machine learning algorithms and Big Data technologies like PySpark to detect whether an executable file is malicious or benign. The system leverages logistic regression for classification, offering a scalable solution using distributed computing on large datasets.

## Key Features
- **Big Data Integration**: Uses PySpark to process large-scale datasets efficiently.
- **Malware Detection**: Detects whether a file is malicious or benign based on its characteristics.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implements a machine learning algorithm to predict malware.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Capable of handling big datasets and making accurate predictions.

## Tools Used
- **PySpark**: Distributed data processing framework used for handling large datasets.
- **Logistic Regression**: The algorithm used for the classification of malicious and benign files.
- **RDDs and DataFrames**: For handling data transformation and processing.
  
## Compilation Instructions
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pyspark
   ```
2. Load the datasets into two RDDs (one for malicious files and another for benign files).
3. Convert the RDDs into DataFrames for further processing.
4. Train a logistic regression model on the training dataset and test it with a split test dataset.
5. Measure and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: Malicious and benign datasets are loaded into RDDs.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the dataset by converting it into DataFrames.
3. **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is trained to classify malware.
4. **Prediction**: After training, the model is tested on new data to classify it as malicious or benign.
  
## Example Code (PySpark Code Snippet)
```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
# Load and prepare data
training_data = spark.read.csv("malware_data.csv")
# Define and train the model
lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol='features', labelCol='label')
model = lr.fit(training_data)
# Test the model
test_results = model.transform(test_data)
```
